# A-Frame: World Effects

This example spawns almonds around the user every 5 seconds and lets users interact with them in AR.
It showcases object spawning, click/touch interaction handling, popup UI feedback, and importing a 3D model.

## Deploy To Netlify

This project is configured for static deployment on Netlify.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build locally (recommended): `npm run build`
3. Push to your Git provider and import the repository into Netlify
4. Deploy with default settings (the repo includes `netlify.toml`)

Netlify CLI flow (optional):

1. `npm i -g netlify-cli`
2. `netlify login`
3. `netlify deploy --build --prod`

### What Is Optimized

- Production builds are generated into `dist` with automatic clean output.
- Stable webpack module/chunk IDs reduce unnecessary bundle churn between deploys.
- `external` static files are served with long-lived immutable cache headers.
- Runtime model/texture assets can be hosted remotely (e.g., S3 URLs in `index.html`).
- `index.html` remains revalidated so updates are picked up quickly.

### Optimizing for Metaversal Deployment

With R18, the all-new 8th Wall Engine features Metaversal Deployment, enabling you to create WebAR experiences once and deploy them to smartphones, tablets, computers and both AR and VR headsets. This project has a few platform-specific customizations:

In **body.html**, we add the ```"allowedDevices: any"``` parameter to our ```xrweb``` component in ```<a-scene>``` 
which ensures the project opens on all platforms, including desktop. Environment parameters 
have been customized to generate an open desert space.

### About World Tracking

Built entirely using standards-compliant JavaScript and WebGL, 8th Wall’s Simultaneous Localization 
and Mapping (SLAM) engine is hyper-optimized for real-time AR on mobile browsers. Features include
Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF), Lighting estimation, instant surface detection and responsive scale.

The Y position of the camera at start effectively determines the scale of virtual content on a surface 
(e.g. smaller y, bigger content). This can be reset at any time by calling 
[```recenter()```](https://www.8thwall.com/docs/web/#recenter).

The camera should NOT be at a height (Y) of zero. It must be set to a non-zero value.

#### Attribution

3D model attribution should reflect the almond asset currently used in the scene (`almond.glb`).
